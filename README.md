# Superstore Data Analysis SQL Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is based on the Superstore Orders dataset (~10,000+ records) and is designed to simulate real-world business scenarios. It focuses on analyzing customer behavior, product performance, and order details to enhance SQL fluency through practical, hands-on problem-solving.

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Technologies Used
- SQL Server
- Git & GitHub

## ðŸ§  Approach
1. Created SQL queries to extract insights
2. Documented findings and final recommendations                

## ðŸ§° SQL Concepts Used
- Aggregate functions: SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX
- Subqueries
- GROUP BY and HAVING filters
- Use of DISTINCT, ordering, and logical conditions

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights
1. customer_analysis.sql
2. product_analysis.sql
3. order_analysis.sql

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Features
- Top 5 Customers by Total Sales
Identify the most valuable customers based on cumulative sales.
- Customers Who Placed Only One Order
List customers who only made a single distinct order.
- Customers Who Purchased More Units Than the Average
Shows customers who bought more units than the average quantity purchased across all customers.
- Customers With Order Count Above Average
Highlights customers whose order count exceeds the average order count.

## âœ… Results
Summarize key outcomes and impact 
- Identified top 5 customers by total sales to guide loyalty and retention strategies
- Detected customers purchasing more units than the average - potential bulk buyers
- Isolated customers placing orders more frequently than average - ideal for upselling
- Calculated average order value to benchmark transaction sizes
- Listed high-value orders (> 2x average) to track exceptional or VIP transactions
- Found days with highest order volume - aids in staffing and campaign planning
- Highlighted best-selling products in each category for stock optimization
- Identified products with high sales frequency but low revenue - potential pricing inefficiencies
- Flagged products never bought in the Corporate segment - market segmentation gap
